**What is a Botnet?**

A botnet is a network of computers infected with malicious software (malware) and controlled by an attacker or cybercriminal. The computers in the botnet can be used to launch coordinated attacks such as account takeover, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, and phishing campaigns, and to steal sensitive information. Botnets can be used for a variety of other malicious activities as well.
